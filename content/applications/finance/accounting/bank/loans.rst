Loans management
================

Odoo lets you manage your loans to have a comprehensive list of all loans undertaken by your company
in order to maintain a holistic and forecasted view of upcoming due dates (e.g., cash forecast).

Create a new loan
-----------------

You can create a new loan by going to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Accounting --> Loans`. When
creating a new loan, you can create your amortization schedule in three ways:

- By importing it from a supported file;
- By calculating it from a couple of values (e.g. the :guilabel:`Amount Borrowed`, the
  :guilabel:`Duration`, etc.);
- By manually filling in the lines of the schedule.

In either case, 3 different fields are required for each line of the amortization schedule: the
:guilabel:`Date`, the :guilabel:`Principal` and the :guilabel:`Interest`.

The :guilabel:`Amount Borrowed`, :guilabel:`Interest` and :guilabel:`Duration` fields will be red
if the sum of the lines does not match the totals amounts you have entered.

Loan entries mechanism
----------------------

When the amount borrowed is credited to your bank account, it should be transferred to a long-term
account (defined in the loan settings). Then, upon the validation of the loan, Odoo will create all
the necessary journal entries such that you can always have a holistic and forecast view of upcoming
due dates. The entire process is completely automated with a reclassification of long-term and
short-term principal reclassification mechanism.

For each line of the amortization schedule, Odoo creates the following entries:

A payment entry on the same date that
  - debits the principal amount from the long-term account;
  - debit the interest amount from the expense account;
  - credits the payment amount to the short-term account: this is the amount that will be
    withdrawn by the bank

A reclassification entry on the same date that
  - debits the sum of the principal amounts of the next 12 months from the long-term account;
  - credits the sum of the principal amounts of the next 12 months to the short-term account.

A reversed entry of the reclassification entry on *the next day* that
  - simply reverses the previous one

With this mechanism, month after month, the short-term account is always up to date, with the
current short-term due amounts.

Closing a loan
--------------

By default, a loan will be closed whenever its last payment entry is posted. However, if can also
be manually closed (e.g. because it is being paid off early) by clicking on the :guilabel:`Close`
button. A wizard will appear asking you from which date the loan should be closed. All draft entries
after this date will be deleted too.

A loan can also be cancelled. In that case, all entries will be deleted even if they were already
posted.

Loans Analysis Report
---------------------

By going to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Reporting --> Loans Analysis`, you can access a
report where you will see a pivot view of your ongoing loans. By default, the report shows
the principal, interest and total payment for each year for the duration of the loan.
